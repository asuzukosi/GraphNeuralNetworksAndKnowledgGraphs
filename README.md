## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are powerful tools in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning. GNNs allow us to analyze structured data in the form of graphs, while KGs store and represent complex knowledge in a structured way. This project aims to facilitate the exploration and understanding of these topics.

## 2. Goals and Objectives <a name="goals-and-objectives"></a>
